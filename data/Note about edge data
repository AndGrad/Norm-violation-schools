Note about edge data

From Anxo:

Hi again, 

and here you are the social data, in the form of an edge list, self-explanatory I believe (but ask anything if it isn't). One thing is that there will be mismatches of information, meaning some students may have been present in one survey and not in the other. But as in both cases the rate of answers is higher than 80%, there should be a lot of students about which you have both types of data. 

My student Miguel tells me that he just did it for us (he has to join two sources of data) so there might also be some mistake here and there. So if you find anything strange just let me know and we'll check. 

Have a great weekend,
